# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 06/02/2025

Osprey is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our browser extension operates and how
we handle your data.

## Data Collection and Use

Osprey does not collect or store any personal data from its users. We do not have access to your browsing history or any
other data that can personally identify you.

## URL Checking

When you navigate to a website, Osprey may send the URL to the third-party threat intelligence providers listed in the
project's [README.md](https://github.com/Foulest/Osprey/blob/main/README.md) file to check for malicious content. These
services are designed to enhance your browsing security by identifying potential threats. Please be aware that the data
sent to these services is limited to the URL you are visiting and is not stored by Osprey.

## Third-Party Services

The third-party services listed in the project's [README.md](https://github.com/Foulest/Osprey/blob/main/README.md)
file may have their own privacy policies regarding the information they collect and how they use it. We encourage you
to review their privacy policies for more information.

## User Liability

Some providers may require a valid license or API key. Although those options might be enabled by default, if you enable
any integration, you must ensure you have the right to do so. Osprey makes no guarantee that enabling an integration
complies with the provider's Terms of Service. Any legal, financial, or technical issues arising from unauthorized use,
such as service suspension, inaccurate threat data, or TOS violations, are solely your responsibility. Osprey is provided
"as-is." We are not liable for interruptions, errors, or claims resulting from unauthorized API calls. Use third-party
services at your own risk. You agree to hold Osprey and its maintainers harmless from any claims, damages, or costs
related to enabling or using integrations you are not licensed to use.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the
new Privacy Policy on this page with a new effective date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically
